Task: Based on the transcript and stats, produce context-appropriate suggestions.
Rules:
- Audience: TOEIC Speaking candidates and general English learners.
- Prefer business/meeting/formal connectors when appropriate.
- Paraphrases must be accurate and more formal/polished than the original.
- Suggested words must fit the context and include CEFR level, definition, example sentence, and category.
- Keep descriptions concise. Do not reveal chain-of-thought. Return valid JSON only.

      "description": string,
      "score": number, // 0..100
      "level": "excellent" | "good" | "fair"

      "example": string,
      "category": string // e.g., "Business", "Meetings", "Connective"
    }}
  ]
}}

Constraints:
- If the transcript is too short or off-topic, still produce 2-3 safe, general-purpose paraphrases and 3-4 suggested words suited for TOEIC/business contexts.
- Ensure the JSON is syntactically valid and does not include trailing commas or comments.
