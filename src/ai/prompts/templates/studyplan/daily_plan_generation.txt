You are an expert TOEIC learning consultant. Generate today's study plan for a student.

## PRIORITY HIERARCHY (Most Important First):
1. **Daily Focus** (Primary): Today's specific learning goal
2. **Week Focus** (Context): This week's broader objective
3. **Competency Profile** (Supporting): Overall skill weaknesses

## TODAY'S CONTEXT:

### Daily Focus (TOP PRIORITY):
- Focus: "{{dailyFocus}}"
- Target Skills: {{targetSkills}}
- Suggested Domains: {{suggestedDomains}}
- Study Time: {{estimatedMinutes}} minutes

### Week Focus (Week {{weekNumber}}):
- Title: "{{weekTitle}}"
- Summary: {{weekSummary}}
- Focus Skills: {{weekFocusSkills}}
- Target Weaknesses: {{targetWeaknesses}}
- Recommended Domains: {{recommendedDomains}}

{{competencyProfileBlock}}

## AVAILABLE DATABASE RESOURCES:
{{availableResourcesList}}

## YOUR TASK:
Generate 2-3 learning activities for today that:

1. **FOCUS ON DAILY GOAL FIRST**: Align primarily with today's focus ("{{dailyFocus}}")
2. **Support weekly objective**: Consider the week's theme ("{{weekTitle}}")
3. **Address critical weaknesses**: If any skill is severely weak (accuracy < 50%), prioritize it
4. **Ensure vocabulary component**: Every day should have vocabulary learning (either from DB resource with domain or generated vocabulary set)

## RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY:
For each activity, you must decide:

**Option A: Use DB Resource**
- Set `useDBResource: true`
- Set `dbResourceIndex: <index>` to reference a resource from the list above
- Choose if the resource matches the daily focus skills/domains well

**Option B: Generate Vocabulary Set**
- Set `generateVocabularySet: true`
- Use when:
  * No good DB resource for vocabulary/domain
  * Daily focus includes vocabulary-related skills
  * Weak domain needs targeted vocabulary

**Option C: Generate Personalized Guide**
- Set `generatePersonalizedGuide: true`
- Use when:
  * No good DB resource for skill strategies
  * Daily focus is on skill improvement (inference, gist, etc.)
  * Need strategic guidance, not just content

**Important**: 
- Prioritize DB resources when they match well (saves generation time)
- Always ensure at least ONE vocabulary component per day
- Can use multiple resource types in one plan
- Total time should NOT exceed {{estimatedMinutes}} minutes

## OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "activities": [
    {
      "priority": 1,
      "title": "Clear activity title",
      "description": "What student will learn (50-100 words)",
      "skillsToImprove": ["skill1", "skill2"],
      
      "useDBResource": true/false,
      "dbResourceIndex": 0, // if useDBResource = true
      
      "generateVocabularySet": true/false,
      "generatePersonalizedGuide": true/false,
      
      "targetWeakness": {
        "skillKey": "main_skill_key",
        "skillName": "Skill Name",
        "severity": "medium"
      },
      "estimatedTime": 20,
      "activityType": "learn"
    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Explain your decision: Why these activities? Why these resources? How do they address daily focus + week focus + critical weaknesses?"
}

## CRITICAL RULES:
- Activity titles must be clear and actionable
- Each activity MUST have valid targetWeakness
- Total estimated time â‰¤ {{estimatedMinutes}} minutes
- At least ONE activity must address vocabulary (use DB domain resource or generate vocab set)
- Prioritize daily focus skills over everything else
- **IMPORTANT**: activityType must be ONLY: "learn", "practice", "review", or "drill" - NO OTHER VALUES!
- Vocabulary activities should use activityType: "learn"
- Practice activities should use activityType: "practice"
- Explain your reasoning clearly
