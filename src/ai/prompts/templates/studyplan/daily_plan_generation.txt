## PRIORITY HIERARCHY (Most Important First):
1. **Daily Focus** (Primary): Today's specific learning goal
2. **Week Focus** (Context): This week's broader objective
3. **Competency Profile** (Supporting): Overall skill weaknesses
4. MUST generate at least one practice drill based on the mistake; generate a practice drill for the resource learning type if necessary
5. Every activities must include at least one resource or at least one practiceDrill. Do not create a activities without a resource or a practiceDrill.
If neither can be determined, create a resource type Personalized Guide in Options C below with step-by-step instructions.

## TODAY'S CONTEXT:

### Daily Focus (TOP PRIORITY):
- Focus: "{{dailyFocus}}"
- Target Skills: {{targetSkills}}
- Suggested Domains: {{suggestedDomains}}
- Study Time: {{estimatedMinutes}} minutes

### Week Focus (Week {{weekNumber}}):
- Title: "{{weekTitle}}"
- Summary: {{weekSummary}}
- Focus Skills: {{weekFocusSkills}}
- Target Weaknesses: {{targetWeaknesses}}
- Recommended Domains: {{recommendedDomains}}

### User Learning Preferences (Supplementary Context - Do NOT override priorities):
- Preferred Study Time: {{preferredStudyTime}} (morning | afternoon | evening | night) - Consider intensity
- Content Interests: {{contentInterests}} - Minor preference, use if it naturally fits

## MISTAKES TO PRACTICE:
{{mistakesToReviewBlock}}

## MISSED SESSIONS (CATCH-UP CONTENT):
{{missedSessionsBlock}}

## AVAILABLE DATABASE RESOURCES:
{{availableResourcesList}}

## YOUR TASK:
Generate 2-5 learning activities for today that:

1. **FOCUS ON DAILY GOAL FIRST**: Align primarily with today's focus ("{{dailyFocus}}")
2. **Support weekly objective**: Consider the week's theme ("{{weekTitle}}")
3. **Address critical weaknesses**: If any skill is severely weak (accuracy < 50%), prioritize it
4. **Ensure vocabulary component**: Every day should have vocabulary learning (either from DB resource with domain or generated vocabulary set)
5. **CATCH UP MISSED SESSIONS**: If there are missed sessions listed above, you MUST create additional review activities that cover the missed focus areas, target skills, and suggested domains from those sessions. 
Integrate this catch-up content seamlessly into today's plan while keeping total time within {{estimatedMinutes}} minutes, focus on guide/instructions instead of practice drill

## RESOURCE ALLOCATION STRATEGY:
For each activity, you must decide:

**Option A: Use DB Resource**
- Set `useDBResource: true`
- Set `dbResourceIndex: <index>` to reference a resource from the list above
- Choose if the resource matches the daily focus skills/domains well

**Option B: Generate Vocabulary Set**
- Set `generateVocabularySet: true`
- Use when:
  * No good DB resource for vocabulary/domain
  * Daily focus includes vocabulary-related skills
  * Weak domain needs targeted vocabulary

**Option C: Generate Personalized Guide**
- Set `generatePersonalizedGuide: true`
- Use when:
  * No good DB resource for skill strategies
  * Daily focus is on skill improvement (inference, gist, etc.)
  * Need strategic guidance, not just content

**Option D: Generate Practice Drill**
- Set `generatePracticeDrill: true`
- **Option D1: Review Specific Mistakes (Use practiceQuestionIds)**
  * Set `practiceQuestionIds: [array of question IDs]` from MISTAKES TO PRACTICE block
  * Use when there are mistakes that need immediate review
  * Min 10 questions, max 30 questions
  * Leave `targetPracticeSkills` and `targetPracticeDomains` empty
- **Option D2: Practice by Skills/Domains (Leave practiceQuestionIds empty)**
  * **IMPORTANT**: You MUST use EXACT skill names from "AVAILABLE SKILLS" section above
  * Set `targetPracticeSkills: [array]` - Choose from the skill lists above (e.g., ["inferImplication", "mainTopic"])
  * Set `targetPracticeDomains: [array]` - Use UPPERCASE domains (e.g., ["BUSINESS", "TECHNOLOGY", "FINANCE"])
  * System will automatically find questions matching these criteria
  * Use when:
    + Need general practice on specific skills (not reviewing mistakes)
    + Want to reinforce learning through targeted new questions
    + Daily focus requires skill practice but no mistakes available
  * **You MUST specify at least skills OR domains** - cannot leave both empty
  * **CRITICAL**: Use EXACT skill names - do NOT create custom skill names like "grammar_foundation_P5"
- Set `minCorrectAnswers: number` (typically 60% of estimated questions)
- Set `drillInstructions: string` with clear guidance
- **Simple Logic**: Correct answers in mistake drills will be REMOVED from mistake stack, wrong answers stay
- With total study time = {{estimatedMinutes}} minutes:
  - If ≤ 15 minutes ⇒ aim for 5–8 questions
  - If 20–25 minutes ⇒ aim for 10–15 questions
  - If 30–40 minutes ⇒ aim for 15–25 questions
- Always set set minCorrectAnswers=0 when use Option D2: Practice by Skills/Domains, Set `minCorrectAnswers` = ceil(0.6 × estimated_questions) when Review Specific Mistakes

**Important**: 
- Prioritize DB resources when they match well (saves generation time)
- Always ensure at least ONE vocabulary component per day
- Can use multiple resource types in one plan
- If there are mistakes to review, consider including a practice drill activity
- Total time should NOT exceed {{estimatedMinutes}} minutes

    }
  ],
  "reasoning": "Explain your decision: Why these activities? Why these resources? How do they address daily focus + week focus + critical weaknesses? For practice drills, explain which skills/domains you chose and why."
}

## CRITICAL RULES:
- Activity titles must be clear and actionable
- Each activity MUST have valid targetWeakness
- Total estimated time ≤ {{estimatedMinutes}} minutes
- At least ONE activity must address vocabulary (use DB domain resource or generate vocab set)
- If there are mistakes to practice, strongly consider including a practice drill with `practiceQuestionIds`
- **PRACTICE DRILL REQUIREMENTS**:
  * For mistake review: Use `practiceQuestionIds` from MISTAKES TO PRACTICE block
  * For skill/domain practice: **MUST** use EXACT skill names from "AVAILABLE SKILLS" section
  * **MUST** provide either `targetPracticeSkills` OR `targetPracticeDomains` (or both)
  * **CANNOT** create custom skill names - only use the exact names listed above
  * Good examples: ["inferImplication", "mainTopic"], ["wordForm", "verbTenseMood"]
  * Bad examples: ["grammar_foundation_P5", "inference_skills", "reading_comprehension"]
  * Available domains: BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY, HEALTHCARE, FINANCE, EDUCATION, TRAVEL, HOSPITALITY, OFFICE, MARKETING
- **MISSED SESSIONS INTEGRATION**: If missed sessions are present, create additional activities that review those missed focus areas, covering their target skills and domains. Balance today's focus with catch-up content within the time budget.
- For practice drills: Depending on the learner's skill level and weakness to decide number of question, maximum 30 question, set reasonable minCorrectAnswers based on total question
- Prioritize daily focus skills over everything else
- **IMPORTANT**: activityType must be ONLY: "learn", "practice", "review", or "drill" - NO OTHER VALUES!
- Practice drill activities should use activityType: "drill"
- Vocabulary activities should use activityType: "learn"
- Practice activities should use activityType: "practice"
- Catch-up/review activities for missed sessions should use activityType: "review"
- Explain your reasoning clearly, especially:
  * Why you chose these activities and resources
  * How they address daily focus + week focus + critical weaknesses
  * **For practice drills**: Which EXACT skills/domains you selected (from the list above) and why they match the learning goals
  * How you integrated missed sessions into the plan (if applicable)
