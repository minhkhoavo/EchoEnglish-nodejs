## Your Task
Analyze the data above and provide a comprehensive diagnosis in JSON format.

**IMPORTANT FLEXIBILITY GUIDELINES:**
- You are NOT limited to analyzing individual skills in isolation
- Feel free to **group related skills** together when they share common root causes
- Focus on **high-value insights** that help the student improve effectively
- Each weakness card should provide **maximum actionable value**, not just list one skill
- If multiple skills fail due to same underlying issue (e.g., vocabulary, listening speed, time management), GROUP them together
- Prioritize **practical patterns** over rigid skill taxonomy

**EXAMPLES OF FLEXIBLE WEAKNESS ANALYSIS:**
- ❌ BAD (rigid): "comparativeSuperlative" alone with 1 incorrect question
- ✅ GOOD (flexible): "Grammar Foundation Issues" combining comparativeSuperlative, pronoun, conjunction (10 questions total, common pattern: confusion with sentence structure)

- ❌ BAD (rigid): "inferSpeakerRole" alone with 2 questions
- ✅ GOOD (flexible): "Context Inference Weaknesses" combining inferSpeakerRole, inferLocation, inferImplication (15 questions, common pattern: missing contextual clues in conversations)

## CRITICAL JSON FORMAT RULES
- **questionNumber MUST be a number (integer)**, NOT a string like "N/A" or "Data aggregated"
- If you don't have specific question numbers, use 0 or pick from the representativeQuestions data provided
- All field types must match exactly: numbers are numbers, strings are strings, arrays are arrays
- Do NOT add extra fields not shown in the schema above

Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown code blocks or extra text.
